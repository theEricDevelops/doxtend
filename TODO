# TODO Items:
-----

In no particular order, these are some of the things I've thought about.

- [x] Create Local Install Script (Completed)
- [ ] Create Downloadable Install Script 
    - One that can be downloaded like ollama or docker installer `doxtend-installer.sh`
    - Can be downloaded and installed with the line `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
    - It should download all files necessary into a temporary directory and then go through with install.
- [X] Have install script modify `docker` to point to the correct docker binary on installation
- [X] Create `--uninstall` flag for `docker` that goes through not only deleting files, but also removing from PATH
- [ ] Allow for retaining files that already exist in install directory in case user wants to keep or require uninstall first.
- [ ] ~~Create `--fix` flag for `docker` in case docker gets removed/installed and takes precident in PATH~~
- [ ] In `install.sh`, add a trap statement to catch any errors that occur, but don't keep the install from occuring.
- [X] In `doxtend-helpers.sh`, add better, more descriptive error messages for `jq_installed` and `docker_installed`
- [ ] Add license header / script description for each script.
- [X] Ask user if they want jq to be installed automatically.
- [ ] Create binary that can be distributed for easier access (not sure how possible this one will be but I'd like to try)
- [ ] Add in `-v` flag for `volume` bindings. Ideally, it will allow the user to edit what was created by inspecting the container rather than overriding completely.
- [ ] Add in `-p` flag for `port` bindings. Same idea as volumes.
- [ ] Add in `-n` flag for `network` bindings. Same idea as the previous two.
- [ ] Create better error handling. (i.e. if a container name isn't found, specify that before exiting...)
